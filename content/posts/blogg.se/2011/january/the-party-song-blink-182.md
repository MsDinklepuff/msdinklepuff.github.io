Do you want to come to a party  
My friends picked me up in their truck at 11:30  
This thing's at a frat house but people are cool there  
Well I did if I loved but I never dreamed there  
Would be someone there who would catch my attention  
I wasn't out searching for love or affection  
So I payed my three and the girls got in free  
Shined the beer for tequila and we headed into the party  
  
And then in the backyard some terrible ska band  
Someone in the background was doing a keg stand  
This place is so lame all these girls look the same  
All these guys have no game I wish I would have stayed  
In my bed back at home watching TV alone  
Where I'd put on some porn or have sex on the phone  
Far from people I hate down from anywhere state  
Trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party  
  
And then I saw her standing there  
With green eyes and long blonde hair  
She wasn't wearing underwear at least i prayed that  
She might be the one, maybe we'd have some fun  
Maybe we'd watch the sun rise  
But that night I learned some girls try too hard  
Some girls try too hard (bakground from here on in the chorus "da na na " repeated over and over)  
Yeah, Some girls try too hard to impress  
With the way that they dress  
With those things on their chest  
And the things they suggest to me  
  
I couldn't believe what this lady was saying  
The names she was dropping, the games she was playing  
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Flys  
How she's down with the 'wise well-constructed disguise'  
Now I'd rather go dateless than stay here and hate this  
Her volume of makeup her fake tits were tasteless  
So I said I'd call her but never would bother  
Until I got turned down by another girl at a party  
  
So when you see her standing there  
With green eyes and long blonde hair  
She won't be wearing underwear and you'll discover  
This girl's not the one and she'll never be fun  
You should just turn and run because you'll find out that  
Some girls try too hard (bakground from here on "da na na " repeated over and over)  
some girls try too hard  
And some girls try too hard to impress  
With the way that they dress  
With those things on their chest  
And the things they suggest to me  
Some girls try too hard  
Some girls try too hard
