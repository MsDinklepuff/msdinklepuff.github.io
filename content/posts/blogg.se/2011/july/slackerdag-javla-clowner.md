" I think clowns should sue Stephen King for ruining their credibility. If Stephen King never wrote "It" clowns would still be the harbingers of fun and laughter. But not anymore. Since Stephen King wrote "It" clowns have become as scary as children. And children are only scary because Stephen King wrote "The Shining." You know what? Fuck Stephen King. Because of Stephen King, every time I see a set of twin girls, I get all panicky and I start to taste bile in the back of my throat, but no matter how scared I am I can't help feeling bad for their mother because she has to live in a constant state of fear and apprehension because not only are they twins but chances are that someday they are going to want a clown to come to their birthday party and then the universe will implode because that is way too many creepy things all in one place at one time and that is how black holes are created. They didn't teach you that in science class, but it's true. And you know what else they didn't teach you in science class? When your dog dies of rabies, that's Stephen King's fault because I'm pretty sure he created rabies too. And Syphilis. We should probably assassinate Stephen King preemptively before he makes better AIDS. Clown AIDS. Shit. "

Innan det skrev hon ett inlägg om en viss mister John Wayne Gacy.. Kommer fan inte kunna sova ikväll =(
