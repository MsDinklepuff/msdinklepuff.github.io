WOOOOOOh! I got alot of things to say: first of all.. This will be in english because I've notice I have some non-swedish dudes reading this from a game I played before, Tibia..  
  
This is the only blog submission that I'll write in english.. All other will be in swedish cuz I don't wanna ruin for my swe readers ^^..  
  
Anyways.. First thing, the comments.  
From Cogstroke:  
Do you still play tibia? U are very nice :D  
To Cogstroke: Heey! :D Its been a while^^ .. Well I dont play anymore.. ;/ I dont have time cuz of school..do you?.. aw thanks.. =)  
  
Aand then.. Ive talked to Pierre today.. Its a friend from when I was like 11 or so.. And haha he's 22 now I think.. I was really surprised when he wrote to me on MSN.. I had nature sciense when he did so couldn't talk to much tho.. Anyways was nice hearing from him ;D haha..  
  
Soon my cousin Nathalie from Stockholm will arrive and Im so tired and hungry and really kinda not funny today so I hope it'll be over before she comes ;D
