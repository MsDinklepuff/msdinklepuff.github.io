Aaanywaaaays....  
My latvia buddy is gonna read this and he said I should write about sex or something related just cuz that's nice to read about.. so I'll do that..  
  
But really dunno what to say..  
I can tell you, Marekso, that I had a Sex-lecture in my class on english class. . it was a homework to give a lecture /performance about something and I choosed sex.. haha.. my class thought I was kinda.. wierd.. but they liked it and said I was good when I stood there and talked about sexual disceses and such... :P I even showed my minipills ..  
Buuut.. I can...write some facts! :O I've found on the net and not sure how true they are but anyways.. And it's from sweden btw xD  
  
The research I've found is from the year 1996 and the age on that research was 18 to 72.  
It shows that women lose their virginity somewhere around 6 months before men do,  
womens average age was 16,4 and mens age was about 16,9 years old.  
  
Although the research clearly shows how much less active women are, the 10% most active women have had from 15 to 100 partners each.  
while the most active men have had from 29 to 560 partners each.  
  
But the research also showed that men are much more unfaithful since 38% of men had been in a marriage/cohabit (SWEDISH: SAMBO!) and still have had other sexual relationships with someone else.  
Among women there was only 23% with such experience..  
  
The most normal sex was vaginal and the must unusual form of sex was analsex.  
  
It is actually really normal to fantasize about the same gender and there was a total of 10% of the asked people who said they have had sexual fantasies about the same gender. Although it was a very clear image of women fantasizing about this more than men.  
  
AND BTW! Since you're not swedish, Its only a sterotype that all swedish girls are "jail bait" or .. yea.. u know what Im sayin xD Not everyone is so easy to have sex with and.. jhmm.. I dunno what more to say..  
  
Can tell you a little about stupid swedish men -.- There's alot of rapes in sweden and at the moment there's two guys in my town (Jönköping) that are really good at raping people..:P It's all over the new's and "wanted-people-programs" and that.. sucks for me xD.. Hate stupid people.. And hmm I can tell you about..  
AFF hate that u dont live in latvia anymore.. Our school is going there and it would be cool to meet you..
