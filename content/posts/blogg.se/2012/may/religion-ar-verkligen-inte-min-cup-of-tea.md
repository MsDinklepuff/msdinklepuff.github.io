Sitter och väntar på att alla mina bilder ska överföras så jag kan börja plugga på bilderna (det är foton från mikroskåpiska preparat) och under tiden tänkte jag bara berätta om en text jag just läste. En av mina favorit killkompisar hade postat en bild på FB där det stod "please read, its worth it"  
Så jag läste.. Och såhär stod det:  
  
Professor : You are a Christian, aren’t you, son ?  
...Student : Yes, sir.  
  
Professor: So, you believe in GOD ?  
  
Student : Absolutely, sir.  
  
Professor : Is GOD good ?  
  
Student : Sure.  
  
Professor: Is GOD all powerful ?  
  
Student : Yes.  
  
Professor: My brother died of cancer even though he prayed to GOD to heal him. Most of us would attempt to help others who are ill. But GOD didn’t. How is this GOD good then? Hmm?  
  
(Student was silent.)  
  
Professor: You can’t answer, can you ? Let’s start again, young fella. Is GOD good?  
  
Student : Yes.  
  
Professor: Is satan good ?  
  
Student : No.  
  
Professor: Where does satan come from ?  
  
Student : From … GOD …  
  
Professor: That’s right. Tell me son, is there evil in this world?  
  
Student : Yes.  
  
Professor: Evil is everywhere, isn’t it ? And GOD did make everything. Correct?  
  
Student : Yes.  
  
Professor: So who created evil ?  
  
(Student did not answer.)  
  
Professor: Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things exist in the world, don’t they?  
  
Student : Yes, sir.  
  
Professor: So, who created them ?  
  
(Student had no answer.)  
  
Professor: Science says you have 5 Senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Tell me, son, have you ever seen GOD?  
  
Student : No, sir.  
  
Professor: Tell us if you have ever heard your GOD?  
  
Student : No , sir.  
  
Professor: Have you ever felt your GOD, tasted your GOD, smelt your GOD? Have you ever had any sensory perception of GOD for that matter?  
  
Student : No, sir. I’m afraid I haven’t.  
  
Professor: Yet you still believe in Him?  
  
Student : Yes.  
  
Professor : According to Empirical, Testable, Demonstrable Protocol, Science says your GOD doesn’t exist. What do you say to that, son?  
  
Student : Nothing. I only have my faith.  
  
Professor: Yes, faith. And that is the problem Science has.  
  
Student : Professor, is there such a thing as heat?  
  
Professor: Yes.  
  
Student : And is there such a thing as cold?  
  
Professor: Yes.  
  
Student : No, sir. There isn’t.  
  
(The lecture theater became very quiet with this turn of events.)  
  
Student : Sir, you can have lots of heat, even more heat, superheat, mega heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat. But we don’t have anything called cold. We can hit 458 degrees below zero which is no heat, but we can’t go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold. Cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it.  
  
(There was pin-drop silence in the lecture theater.)  
  
Student : What about darkness, Professor? Is there such a thing as darkness?  
  
Professor: Yes. What is night if there isn’t darkness?  
  
Student : You’re wrong again, sir. Darkness is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light. But if you have no light constantly, you have nothing and its called darkness, isn’t it? In reality, darkness isn’t. If it is, well you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn’t you?  
  
Professor: So what is the point you are making, young man ?  
  
Student : Sir, my point is your philosophical premise is flawed.  
  
Professor: Flawed ? Can you explain how?  
  
Student : Sir, you are working on the premise of duality. You argue there is life and then there is death, a good GOD and a bad GOD. You are viewing the concept of GOD as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, Science can’t even explain a thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing.  
  
Death is not the opposite of life: just the absence of it. Now tell me, Professor, do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?  
  
Professor: If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, yes, of course, I do.  
  
Student : Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?  
  
(The Professor shook his head with a smile, beginning to realize where the argument was going.)  
  
Student : Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor. Are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you not a scientist but a preacher?  
  
(The class was in uproar.)  
  
Student : Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the Professor’s brain?  
  
(The class broke out into laughter. )  
  
Student : Is there anyone here who has ever heard the Professor’s brain, felt it, touched or smelt it? No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established Rules of Empirical, Stable, Demonstrable Protocol, Science says that you have no brain, sir. With all due respect, sir, how do we then trust your lectures, sir?  
  
(The room was silent. The Professor stared at the student, his face unfathomable.)  
  
Professor: I guess you’ll have to take them on faith, son.  
  
Student : That is it sir … Exactly ! The link between man & GOD is FAITH. That is all that keeps things alive and moving.  
  
P.S.  
  
I believe you have enjoyed the conversation. And if so, you’ll probably want your friends / colleagues to enjoy the same, won’t you?  
  
Forward this to increase their knowledge … or FAITH.  
  
By the way, that student was EINSTEIN.  
  
  
Seriöst? HAH.  
  
  
FIRST of all. Vem fan tror på att det där var einstein? den som har minsta lilla aning om vem einstein var som person hade förstått detta. Denna text (iallafall extremt lik) läste jag btw för några år sen redan.. och jag bara kände men.. wtf? .. typiskt jönköping.. Och sen tycker jag det är riktigt fult att dom i början frågar om han var christian?.. Jag menar .. Muslimerna då? dom tror också på gud.. Eller andra religioner.. Aaah damp alltså. tröttsamt, faktiskt.. riktigt jävla tröttsamt  
jag orkar inte ens komma med äkta kritik till den där eftersom jag uppenbart ser att vem som helst som hade tänkt TILL, faktiskt hade förstått lite enklare att det är en massa bullshit, det enda som är true är väl just att faith kopplar ihop man och god..  
Ah. men mer kritik än så blir det inte..  
  
jag har som sagt INGET emot folk som tror på whatever. Ni får tro hur mycket ni vill . MEN när man aktivt laddar upp sånna här saker (som någon (förmodligen utländsk) Coey snubbe gjort då) då känns det som man är riktigt jäkla obildad.. Spelar ingen roll hur mycket man tror, man kan ändå ha lite kritik till texter. Visssa kanske blir arga nu, men jag ska ge er ett konkret exempel.  
  
Tänk er t.ex. att ni läser om någon annan religion än just eran, då är ni direkt kritiska. Eller hur?   
Var det nu också...
