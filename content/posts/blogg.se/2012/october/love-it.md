Jag älskar dagar som igår. Och jag älskar inspirerande saker som jag såg idag.  
Igår satt jag hela kvällen (och illa nog sent på kvällen) och snackade med hasse och kirsty på skype :) älskar att prata med mina loved ones..  
  
Och det som inspirerade mig idag var en nyhet .. Någon hade lagt upp en post på reddit om en kvinna som såg ut som en man (pga hårväxt) .. hon svarade så jävla inspirerande. Finemang!

you go Balpreet Kaur!

Drar ur texten som hon skrev här, verkar smidigast :) hennes svar kommer från den här länken http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/109cnf/im\_not\_sure\_what\_to\_conclude\_from\_this/  
  
  

_Hey, guys. This is Balpreet Kaur, the girl from the picture. I actually didn't know about this until one of my friends told on facebook. If the OP wanted a picture, they could have just asked and I could have smiled :) However, I'm not embarrased or even humiliated by the attention \[negative and positve\] that this picture is getting because, it's who I am. Yes, I'm a baptized Sikh woman with facial hair. Yes, I realize that my gender is often confused and I look different than most women. However, baptized Sikhs believe in the sacredness of this body - it is a gift that has been given to us by the Divine Being \[which is genderless, actually\] and, must keep it intact as a submission to the divine will. Just as a child doesn't reject the gift of his/her parents, Sikhs do not reject the body that has been given to us. By crying 'mine, mine' and changing this body-tool, we are essentially living in ego and creating a seperateness between ourselves and the divinity within us. By transcending societal views of beauty, I believe that I can focus more on my actions. My attitude and thoughts and actions have more value in them than my body because I recognize that this body is just going to become ash in the end, so why fuss about it? When I die, no one is going to remember what I looked like, heck, my kids will forget my voice, and slowly, all physical memory will fade away. However, my impact and legacy will remain: and, by not focusing on the physical beauty, I have time to cultivate those inner virtues and hopefully, focus my life on creating change and progress for this world in any way I can. So, to me, my face isn't important but the smile and the happiness that lie behind the face are. :-) So, if anyone sees me at OSU, please come up and say hello. I appreciate all of the comments here, both positive and less positive because I've gotten a better understanding of myself and others from this. Also, the yoga pants are quite comfortable and the Better Together tshirt is actually from Interfaith Youth Core, an organization that focuses on storytelling and engagement between different faiths. :) I hope this explains everything a bit more, and I apologize for causing such confusion and uttering anything that hurt anyone._

hur awesome? :D
